      <p><strong>Admirable women in the history of computer programming.</strong></p>

      <p>Ada Lovelace best understood the promise and the potential that computers would one day fulfill. The first programmable computer—if it were built—would have been a gigantic, mechanical thing clunking along with gears and levers and punch cards.
        That was the vision for Analytical Engine devised by British inventor Charles Babbage in 1837. Lovelace was a gifted mathematician and intellectual who translated an Italian article on the Analytical Engine and supplemented it with extensive notes
        on the machine’s capabilities. In these notes she not only explained the engine more clearly than Babbage had been able to, but she also described an algorithm it could carry out that is often considered to be the world’s first computer program.

      <div class="title">Hedy Lamarr</div>
      <p> At the beginning of World War II, Hedy Lamarr and composer George Antheil developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, intended to use frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. Although
        the US Navy did not adopt the technology until the 1960s, various spread-spectrum techniques are incorporated into Bluetooth technology and are similar to methods used in legacy versions of Wi-Fi. This work led to their induction into the National
        Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014. That brilliant idea called frequency hopping was a way of jumping around on radio frequencies in order to avoid a third party jamming your signal. Lamarr invented it in the 1940s for use as a secret wartime communication
        system that could keep the enemy from interfering with a ship’s torpedoes. She got a patent for it in August 1942, and then donated it to the U.S. military to help fight the Nazis. </p>

      <div class="title">Grace Hopper</div>
      <p>Grace Hopper joined the U.S. Navy during World War II and was assigned to program the Mark I computer. She continued to work in computing after the war, leading the team that created the first computer language compiler, which led to the popular
        COBOL language. She resumed active naval service at the age of 60, becoming a rear admiral before retiring in 1986.Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve in 1966, but her pioneering computer work meant that she was recalled to active duty—at the
        age of 60—to tackle standardizing communication between different computer languages. She would remain with the Navy for 19 years. When she retired in 1986, at age 79, she was a rear admiral as well as the oldest serving officer in the service.
        As a research fellow at Harvard, she worked with the Mark II and Mark III computers. She was at Harvard when a moth was found to have shorted out the Mark II, and is given credit for the invention of the term "computer bug". </p>
